Good with food cooked with herbs, such as fish with dill or oregano and chicken with sage or thyme.  It also makes a good fit with chiles, lemongrass, ginger, garlic, and cilantro, so it's often a perfect match for Thai, Indian, and Mexican dishes.", 4);
INSERT INTO cards (card_order, question, answer, deck_id) VALUES (1,"Riesling", "White - as a light table wine with a hint of sweetness, it's unfashionable in an age of dry wines, and the fact that the grape is often made into intensely sweet dessert-style wines creates further confusion among consumers.  Bold rieslings of Australia or New Zealand are perfect wines for the spice and savor of Chinese, Thai and Mexican dishes or stir-fries, grilled shellfish, and barbecued pork.", 4);
INSERT INTO cards (card_order, question, answer, deck_id) VALUES (1,"Pinot Grigio", "White - not generally considered much of a match for most meals, but when it's good, it's quite pleasant as a drink--relatively low in acid, medium-bodied and quite dry.  Wines from the same grape made in the Alsace region of France and in Oregon, known as Pinot Gris, can provide more consistent pleasure, on their own or as good companions to light hot or cold fish dishes, salmon mousse, fish cakes, or gravlax, and pasta with pesto or cheese-based sauces.", 4);
INSERT INTO cards (card_order, question, answer, deck_id) VALUES (1,"Cabernet Sauvignon", "Red - a very tannic wine to begin with and most of the words used to describe it are almost disparaging: 'hard', 'angular', 'austere'.  It tends to be blended with small amounts of grapes to add aroma, spice and fruitiness.  Original home in Bordeaux, over five years it begins to soften, and the fruitiness comes to the fore.  Best partnered with roast lamb or grilled lamb chops, char-grilled steak, filet mignon, calf's liver with bacon and onions, venison, squab and any red meat with a rich, reduced sauce.", 4);
INSERT INTO cards (card_order, question, answer, deck_id) VALUES (1,"Merlot", "Red - another red wine of Bordeaux, mellower from the start so more ready to drink at an earlier age.  A smooth and lively fine wine, a splendid partner for roast lamb or duck, grilled steak, lamb or beef stew, and braised meat in reduced sauces.", 4);
INSERT INTO cards (card_order, question, answer, deck_id) VALUES (1,"Zinfandel", "Red - (the original deep red wine, not to be confused with white zinfandel) was long known as \"California's mystery grape\" because no one knew where it had originated.  The mystery has been solved, it has descended from a southern Italian variety known as Primitivo.  It has been a very successful transplant indeed--robust in every way, bursting with ripe blackberry jam flavor, vibrantly acidic and fairly high in alcohol with a bracing jolt of astringent tannin.  A well-made Zinfandel will be superb five years after the vintage date and can easily age for at least ten years.  A good match for hearty food such as roast pork with gravy or rich sauce, osso bucco, and slow-braised lamb shanks, as well as pasta with spicy sausages, tomato-based chicken fricasses, and even first-rate cheeseburgers.", 4);
INSERT INTO cards (card_order, question, answer, deck_id) VALUES (1,"Pinot Noir", "Red - for many winemakers and connoisseurs this is the ultimate wine.  Originally from Burgunday in France, it has been celebrated for nearly a thousand years.  It is smooth and relatively light, but with a persistent lingering flavor, a unique combination of delicacy and power, often characterized as an iron fist in a velvet glove.  Classically paired with a rare roast beef.  Also dark-meat poultry is another favorite, especially duck and quail, while it's lightness makes it a good red for turkey.", 4);
